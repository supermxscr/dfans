    - Whilst we do not own your Content, you grant us the limited right to submit notifications of infringement (including of copyright or trademark) on your behalf to any third-party website or service that hosts or is otherwise dealing in infringing copies of your Content without your permission.

    - Links to dFans:
      - You may link to the dFans homepage, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval, or endorsement on our part.

    - If you are a Fan, the deletion of your account will take place within a reasonable time following your request.

    - Once your account has been deleted you won't be charged any further amounts or have access to your former dFans account or its Content, and any subscriptions will be deleted and cannot be subsequently renewed. You will receive an email confirmation upon the successful deletion of your account. Once your account has been deleted, we may deal with your Content in any appropriate manner in accordance with our Privacy Policy (including by deleting it) and you will no longer be entitled to access your Content.

      - has given his or her express, prior, and fully informed consent to his or her appearance in the Co-Authored Content; and

    - You agree that we will only arrange for Creator Earnings to be paid to the account of the Creator to which the Co-Authored Content is uploaded. The Creator who uploaded the Co-Authored Content is solely responsible for dividing and distributing any revenue generated from the Co-Authored Content between the individuals shown in such Co-Authored Content. Any such revenue-sharing agreement shall be an independent, private agreement between you and such individual(s), and we are not responsible for providing or enforcing any such agreements.

    - You agree to release us from and not to make any claims against us arising from Co-Authored Content.

    - To make a withdrawal of Creator Earnings from your dFans account, you must have at least the minimum payout amount in your dFans account.
    - The amount that you see in your ‘current balance’ in your dFans account is your Creator Earnings at the relevant time. All Fan Payments and Creator Earnings are transacted in USD or ETH. If you have chosen the "USDT" Payout Option then the Fan Payments and Creator Earnings figures will be reflected in USDT.
    - If a Fan successfully seeks a refund or chargeback from their credit card provider in respect of a Fan Payment made to you, we may investigate and may decide to deduct from your account an amount equal to the Creator Earnings earned by you on the charged-back or refunded amount.
13. Circumstances in which we may withhold Creator Earnings:
    - We may withhold all or any part of the Creator Earnings due to you but not yet paid out:
      - if we think that you have or may have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service;
      - if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which we think has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User); or
      - if we suspect that all or any part of the Creator Earnings result from unlawful or fraudulent activity, either by you or by the Fan who made the Fan Payment resulting in the Creator Earnings,
    - for as long as is necessary to investigate the actual, threatened or suspected breach by you or the suspected unlawful activity (as applicable). If following our investigation, we conclude that (i) you have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service; (ii) you have attempted or threatened to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User), and/or (iii) the Creator Earnings result from unlawful or fraudulent activity, we may notify you that you have forfeited your Creator Earnings.
    - We may also withhold all or any part of the Creator Earnings due to you but not yet paid out if we receive notice that you have secured, encumbered, pledged, assigned, or otherwise allowed a lien to be placed on Creator Earnings. We undertake no duty to pay Creator Earnings to third-party lienholders and may withhold payment of Creator Earnings until the lien has been removed.
    - We shall not have any responsibility to you if we withhold or forfeit any of your Creator Earnings where we have a right to do so under these Terms of Use for Creators.
    - If we are withholding all or any part of the Creator Earnings due to you and we determine that part of the Creator Earnings withheld by us is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful or fraudulent activity, then we may arrange for you to be paid the part of the Creator Earnings which we determine to be unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful or fraudulent activity. However, you agree that if we consider that your breach(es) of the Terms of Service has or may cause us loss, we may withhold all Creator Earnings due to you but not yet paid and we may set off such amounts against any losses suffered by us.
    - If once we have finished our investigation we determine that Creator Earnings are forfeited, we will (unless prohibited by law) use our best efforts to ensure that any Fan Payments which resulted in forfeited Creator Earnings are returned to the relevant Fans who paid such Fan Payments.
14. Promoting Tax compliance:
    - We recommend that all Creators seek professional advice to ensure you are compliant with your local Tax and VAT rules, based on your individual circumstances.

6. Referral payments: 
   - How are referral payments calculated? Once a Referred Creator has become a registered User of dFans in accordance with the rules of the dFans Referral Program described above, the Referring User will be paid a referral payment equal to five percent (5%) of Fan Payments generated by the Referred Creator in the twelve months after the date on which the Referred Creator becomes a registered User of dFans, up to a maximum referral payment by dFans to the Referring User of US$50,000 per Referred Creator.
   - This means that if a Referred Creator generates Fan Payments with a total value of US$1 million or more in the twelve months after the date on which that Referred Creator becomes a registered User of dFans, then the Referring User's referral payments in relation to that Referred Creator will be capped at US$50,000 in total. However, if the Referred Creator generates Fan Payments with a total value of less than US$1 million in the twelve months after the date on which that Referred Creator becomes a registered User of dFans, then the Referring User will be paid five per cent (5%) of the Fan Payments generated by that Referred Creator in the twelve months after the date on which the Referred Creator becomes a registered User of dFans, following which no further referral payments will be made to the Referring User in respect of that Referred Creator.
   - Warning: In compliance with regulation 3 of the Trading Scheme Regulations 1997 (as amended) and section 120(1) of the Fair Trading Act 1973, please read the warning below in respect of the dFans Referral Program:
     - It is illegal for us or for a participant in the dFans Referral Program (including Referring Users and Referred Creators) to persuade anyone to make a payment by promising benefits from getting others to join the dFans Referral Program.
     - Do not be misled by claims that high earnings are easily achieved from participation in the dFans Referral Program.
   - Choosing a payout method to receive referral payments: In order to be able to receive referral payments you must first choose one of the payout methods provided by dFans in your country of residence. These methods are called "Payout Options".
   - How frequently are referral payments made? The referral payment due to you on Fan Payments made to the Referred Creator in a calendar month will be transferred to you on or around the first day of the next calendar month (which means, for example, that referral payments due to you in respect of Fan Payments made to the Referred Creator in February shall be paid to you on or around 1 March).
   - Who bears the cost of the referral payment? The cost of the referral payment is borne by us, not the Referred Creator.
7. Our rights relating to the referral program.
   - If referral payments have been made incorrectly then we have the right to recover the wrongly paid sums from the User to whom the wrongly paid sums have been paid.
   - We may request you or Referred Creators (or both) to provide us with ID and other information reasonably required by us to verify any referral payment to be made and the person to whom any referral payment should be made. Failure to provide any information requested by us may lead to you losing your entitlement to referral payments in respect of the relevant Referred Creator.
   - We may change any aspect of the dFans Referral Program (including how referral payments are calculated) or discontinue the dFans Referral Program at any time, but no change will deprive any Referring User of referral payments already earned based on Fan Payments made to Referred Creators before the changes came into effect.
8. Circumstances in which we may withhold referral payments:
   - We may withhold all or any part of the referral payments due to you but not yet paid out:
     - if we think that you have or may have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service;
     - if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User); or
     - if we suspect that all or any part of the referral payments due to you result from unlawful or fraudulent activity, either by you, by the Fan who made the Fan Payment to the Referred Creator which resulted in the referral payment, or by the Referred Creator to whom the Fan Payment was made which resulted in the referral payment,
   - for as long as is necessary to investigate the actual, threatened or suspected breach(es) by you or the suspected unlawful or fraudulent activity (as applicable). If following our investigation, we conclude that (i) you have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service; (ii) you have attempted or threatened to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User), and/or (iii) all or any part of referral payments due to you result from unlawful or fraudulent activity, we may notify you that you have forfeited all or any part of your referral payments.
   - We may also withhold all or any part of the referral payments due to you but not yet paid out if we receive notice that you have secured, encumbered, pledged, assigned, or otherwise allowed a lien to be placed on, referral payments. We undertake no duty to pay referral payments to third-party lienholders and may withhold payment of Creator Earnings until the lien has been removed.
   - We shall not have any responsibility to you if we withhold or forfeit any payment due to you under the dFans Referral Program where we have a right to do so under these Referral Program Terms.
   - If we are withholding all or any part of the referral payments due to you and we determine that part of the referral payments withheld by us is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful or fraudulent activity, then we may arrange for you to be paid the part of the referral payments which is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful or fraudulent activity. However, you agree that if we consider that your breach(es) of the Terms of Service has or may cause us loss, we may withhold all referral payments due to you but not yet paid and we may set off such amounts against any losses suffered by us.
